# Simple_Wifi_Scanner
A simple network/ip scanner for windows made in java that uses command prompt to display all IPs and MAC addresses on the network
Works through archaic brute force IP pinging and nslookup

This has only been tested on windows 10

# Instructions:
1) Open main.java in any recent Java IDE
2) If your subnet is not the default 192.168.1 (check with ipconfig) replace string "sub" on line 52 with your subnet IP
2) Run the program and wait up to 5 minutes
